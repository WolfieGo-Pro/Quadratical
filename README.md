# Quadratical
A console program for solving quadratic equations

The program has 4 files.

<h4>main.cpp</h4> // main scope of the program.


<h4>pch.h</h4> // where all the headers are included. It must also be added to all source files (.cpp files).


<h4>Equation.cpp</h4> // class/blueprint for the program.


<h4>Equation.h</h4> // where all data members & methods implemented in 'Equation.cpp' are declared.


<h4>Version Notes</h4> // A brief summary of what a version of the program contains, and what it will contain in future versions.


<h5>Core Process of the program</h5>

While implementing the mathematical method to solve the quadratic equations, I refrained from using the 'almighty formula'.
Instead, I decided to try a different method. 

Every quadratic equation consists of a quadratic term
