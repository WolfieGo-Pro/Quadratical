This project was built to practise allocating memory to objects using the 'new' operator, 
and also to practise returning pointers from functions/methods.
However, other aspects of programming has been incorporated into this project which
will be updated upon from time to time.

Aspects such as:

Modern methods of programming, input validation, efficient memory management techniques etc.

At the moment, the program is efficient & works, which is goal for this version.
Future versions will implement other aspects listed above as well as improve existing code.
